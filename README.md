# Ishaan Singh â€” Poster-style Portfolio

Starter Vite + React + Tailwind project built with a gritty, poster-like aesthetic inspired by Fight Club and Breaking Bad.

Quick start

```bash
cd "portfolio website"
npm install
npm run dev
```

Notes
- Fonts are loaded from Google Fonts; add local files if you prefer.
- Replace images in `/assets` with your portrait and project images.
- Deploy to Vercel/Netlify by pushing this folder to a git repo and using the build command `npm run build`.

Easter egg: open the console to see a Breaking Bad shout-out.
